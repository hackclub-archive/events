## Preparation

Here's a checklist of things that needs to be done before a Hack Night:

- [ ] Choose a time and date
- [ ] Choose a theme
- [ ] Announce Hack Night
  - [ ] Email
  - [ ] [Slack](https://starthackclub.slack.com)
    - [ ] [#annoucements](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/annoucements)
    - [ ] [#hack-night](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/hack-night)

## Event Schedule

### Introductions

Introductions are an icebreaker activity to help hackers learn each other's names.

Have each hacker and say their name and the answer to two questions about themselves. Here's a few example questions:

- What is your weapon of choice?
- What is your favorite animal?
- Where are you from?
- What is your epithet of choice?

In-person Hack Night events will have more than one hacker on the device they are calling in from. Ask if everyone at the meetup introduced themselves before moving on to the next group of hackers.

### Intro talk

The intro talk is given by an organizer of the Hack Night. Make sure to cover the following topics:

1. [ ] Announce theme
2. [ ] All projects should have a permalink (ex. use USERNAME.github.io instead of c9.io)
3. [ ] Check-ins will occur throughout the event
4. [ ] Event schedule (when will demos occur?)

### Check-ins

Check-ins are a way for organizers to see where everyone is at in with their projects.

_**Hackers may have muted their chat when hacking. Make sure to ping @here on the [#hack-night](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/hack-night) channel before getting check-ins started.**_

### Demos

1. [ ] Announce demos ~15 minutes ahead of schedule in the [#hack-night](https://starthackclub.slack.com/messages/hack-night) channel to give hackers a heads up.
2. [ ] Have each hacker post a permalink to their project.
3. [ ] Give a brief explanation on how to demo.
4. [ ] Go through the list of hackers on the call having each demo.
